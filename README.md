# Data-Structure-Employee
A company hired 10 temporary workers who are paid hourly and you are given a data file that contains the
last name of the employees, the number of hours each employee worked in a week, and the hourly pay rate
of each employee. You are asked to write a program that computes each employeeâ€™s weekly pay and the
average salary of all employees. The program then outputs the weekly pay of each employee, the average
weekly pay, and the names of all the employees whose pay is greater than or equal to the average pay.
If the number of hours worked in a week is more than 40, then the pay rate for the hours over 40 is
1.5 times the regular hourly rate.
